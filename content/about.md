Hello there, my name is Bruno Machado and I'm a student of Mechatronic Engineering at Escola Politécnica of Universidade de São Paulo, in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Ever since I was in school, I was very interested in physics and maths. As I grew older, joined University and came into contact with many exciting engineering projects, this interes has matured a lot and nowadays I'm passionate about software development and control techniques for robotics systems. More especifically, I love topics such as embedded software development, artificial inteligence, computational vision and dynamic systems control techniques.

Today, I'm currently a member of the Thunderatz robotics team, where I have worked as a software developer for different competitive robot categories, specially sumo robots and soccer robots. I'm also currently enrolled in a Scientific Iniciation program in which I'm developing the localization system of a scaled down autonomous vehicle whose purpose is to serve as a testing platform for ADAS (Advance Driver Assistance Systems).
