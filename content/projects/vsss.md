### The Very Small Size Soccer Category

The IEEE Very Small Size (VSS) Robot Soccer competition challenges teams to design, build, and program autonomous robots that compete in soccer matches on a small field. Each team uses three or five robots, depending on the competition, each no larger than 7.5 cm in diameter and height, with gameplay controlled by external vision systems and AI algorithms. Robots must make real-time decisions for tasks like passing, shooting, and positioning, all without human intervention. The competition emphasizes robotics, artificial intelligence, and teamwork, providing an educational platform for developing skills in these areas, while fostering innovation in small-scale autonomous systems.

### Thundervolt

Thundervolt is Thunderatz's VSS team, known for its remarkable success, particularly in terms of its advanced behavioral complexity. In the simulated category, the team's biggest achievement is winning a gold medal at the LARC competition, while in the physical category, their greatest accomplishment is securing a silver medal at RCX 2024. Beyond these highlights, Thundervolt has also earned numerous bronze and silver medals in other competitions, solidifying its reputation as a top contender in the VSS arena.

### My Contributions

I worked in the Thundervolt project for one year (2022 - 2023), during this period my main contributions were in:

- The migration of the entire software from the ROS Noetic framework to the ROS 2 Humble framework.
- The adaptation of the 3v3 category software to the 5v5 category.
- The refactoring of the computational vision, specially in the image filtering process.
