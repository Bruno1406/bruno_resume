### The Sumo Category

Robot sumo is a competitive event where robots face off in a sumo-style match, aiming to push each other out of a circular ring called Dohyo. The robots are divided into weight categories, with the most common being the 3 kg and 500 g classes. In the 3 kg category, robots are typically large and powerful, often using complex control systems and stronger motors. Furthermore, in this category the Dohyo is made of steel and the competitors use this to their advantage by attachig very strong magnets to the bottom of the robots. On the other hand, the 500 g category, features smaller, lighter and cheaper robots, requiring more consistency due to the grat number of competitors and matches per competiton. Both categories emphasize, precision in design and strategy, quick movement, stability, and effective sensor use to detect and avoid the opponent while attempting to force them out of the ring.

### Thunderatz's  Robots

The "Equipe de Robótica Thunderatz" is very traditional in the brazillian sumo robot scene, featuring robots such as the l+egendary Stonerange which is to this day one the greatest winners of all time in the category, even though it's been retired for over 3 years.
At the present time, there are four active robots in team: Galena, Moai, Safira and Pedrinha.
Galena is the "heaviest" robot in Brazil, i.e. it is the robot with the greatest normal load. It was also the first robot in Brazil to use a three-ramp system and it has been for years one the best robots in national competitons, with several bronze, silver and gold medals. Conversily, Moai is a 3 kg robot made to be extremilly fast and agile. To achieve this, the robot was designed with two high torque and RPM brushless motors as actuators. Finally, the third and fourth robots are bouth from the 500 g category, with Safira being a very fast and intelligent robot that uses two enconders and an IMU to get around in the Dohyo and Pedrinha being a purely radio controlled robot.

### My contributions

In my two years working in the software team of Thunderatz, I was involved with many of the aforementioned projects, specially in Moai and Safira. Among the contribution, the following stand out:

- Development of C++ firmware libray for many sensors and actuators connected to STMicroelectronics's microcontrollers.
- Development of the FSM (Finite State Machine) that dictates the behavior of Moai.
- Development of ThunderMonitor, a Desktop application that communicates with the embedded application through bluetooth to read, write and display variables in real time.
